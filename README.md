### Abstract

Electrical stimulation of neural populations is a key tool for understanding neural dynamics and developing treatments. To investigate the effects of external stimulation on a basic cortical motif, we analyse the dynamical properties of an efficient mean-field neural mass model of excitatory and inhibitory adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (AdEx) neurons and validate the results using detailed network simulations. 
The state space of the mean-field model and of the detailed network are closely related. They reveal asynchronous up and down-states, bistable regions, and oscillatory regions corresponding to fast excitation-inhibition and slow excitation-adaptation feedback loops. 
Within this dynamical landscape, external stimuli can cause state transitions, such as turning on and off oscillations. Oscillatory input can frequency-entrain and phase-lock endogenous oscillations. The effects of external stimulation are well-predicted by the mean-field model, further underpinning the utility of low-dimensional neural mass models. 	


## Getting Started

In this repository, you find the simulation engine for **(a)** an efficient mean-field mneural mass model of a large network of [AdEx neurons](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Adaptive_exponential_integrate-and-fire_model) and **(b)** the corresponding network simulation of individual neurons implemented in [Brian2](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2). Furthermore, you will find numerous notebooks to replicate our result and plot them figure by figure. The code within these notebooks runs the simulations and stimulation experiments, saves the data, performs data analysis and plots the results.

### Hardware requirements 
The mean-field simulations are fast by nature and require almost no computational resources for a single run. Running the AdEx network using brian for 6 seconds with N=10000 neurons per population (20000 total) takes in the order of 10 minutes to run on a Intel i5 single core.

### Prerequisites

Please install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) on your computer before you clone this repository. Using conda, you can install the python environment which we have provided here (see Installaltion section). This will ensure that you will be able to run all the code files in this repository. Anaconda will also come with [Jupter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) to run and display the notebooks provided here.

### Installation

If you have a git client installed on your computer, the first step is cloning this repository to your computer:

```
git clone https://github.com/caglarcakan/stimulus_neural_populations.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the repository as a zip file from github [here](https://github.com/caglarcakan/stimulus_neural_populations/archive/master.zip). After cloning or downloading the repository, please navigate in your terminal to the directory which contains the project.

#### Anaconda environment

To make it easier to run the code in this project and reproduce our findings, we have created an anaconda environment. This helps you to get all the correct versions of the libraries we have used as well as python 2.7. Please make sure that you have installed anaconda successfully.

The following command creates the anaconda environment on your computer (this can take a while):

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Now activate the environment:

```
conda activate stimulus
```

You can now start the Jupyter Notebook server to view and run the notebooks in this repository using the command:

```
jupyter notebook
```

This should open Jupyter Notebook in your browser.

### Bifurcation diagrams

![Bifurcation diagrams](resources/figure2.jpg)

**Bifurcation diagrams and time series.**
		Bifurcation diagrams a-d depict the state space of the E-I system in terms of the mean external input currents to both subpopulations E and I.
		**(a)** Bifurcation diagram of mean-field model without adaptation with *up* and *down-states*, a bistable region *bi* (green dashed contour) and an oscillatory region LC<sub>EI</sub> (white solid contour). 
		**(b)** Diagram of the corresponding AdEx network. 
		**(c)** Mean-field model with somatic adaptation. The bistable region is replaced by a slow oscillatory region LC<sub>aE</sub>.
		**(d)** Diagram of the corresponding AdEx network.
		The color in panels a - d indicates the maximum population rate of the excitatory population (clipped at 80 Hz). 
		**(e)** Example time series of the population rates of excitatory (red) and inhibitory (blue) populations at point A2 (top row) which is located in the fast excitatory-inhibitory limit cycle LC<sub>EI</sub>, and at point B3 (bottom row) which is located in the slow limit cycle LC<sub>aE</sub>.
